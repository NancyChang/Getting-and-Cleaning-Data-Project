# Getting-and-Cleaning-Data-Project
# Course Project:
# The original data "Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Dataset" is from the course website represent data collected  # from the accelerometers from the Samsung Galaxy S smartphone.
# The goal is to prepare a tidy data which average each variable for each activity and each subject. The variables include 79   # items listed in column names from column 3 to 81. The subjects are a group of 30 volunteers within an age bracket of 19-48
# years and listed in 1 to 30. The activities listed in 1 to 6 represent walking, walking upstairs, walking downstairs, sitting, # standing and laying respectively. 
# The finalized tidy data called "DataSummary.csv", it lists the subject 1 to 30, with different activity listed in 1 to 6, 
# about the average of their 79 kinds of movement variables.
# The code named "run_analysis.R" is used to transform the original dataset to the tidy DataSummary dataset.
